### FactorGraph class

```
FactorGraph(
    N,
    T,
    contacts,
    obs,
    delta,
    mask = ["SI"],
    mask_type = "SI",
    verbose = False
)

        Class to update the BP messages for the SI model

        Arguments
        ---------
        N (int): Number of nodes in the contact network
        T (int): Time at which the simulation stops
        contacts (list): List of all the contacts, each given by a list (i, j, t, lambda_ij(t))
        obs (list): List of the observations, each given by a list (i, 0/1, t), where 0 corresponds to S and 1 to I
        delta (float): Probability for an individual to be a source
        mask (list): if it is equal to ["SI"], the function simulates an SI model, otherwise the i-th element of the list (between 0 and 1) represents the infectivity of the nodes at i timesteps after the infection
        mask_type (string): Type of inference model. If equal to "SIR", it means we are simulating a SIR model and inferring using the dSIR model

        Main methods
        ------------
        iterate(damp): Single iteration of the Belief Propagation algorithm
        update(maxit, tol, damp, print_iter): Multiple iterations of the BP algorithm through the iterate method
        marginals(): Computes the array of the BP marginals for each node
        reset_obs(obs): Resets the observations, starting from a provided list.
```

### SparseTensor class

```
SparseTensor(
    N = 0,
    T = 0,
    contacts = [],
    Tensor_to_copy = None
)

        Class to represent an N x N x T x T sparse tensor as a 2 x num_edges x T x T full tensor

        Arguments
        ---------
        N (int): Number of nodes in the contact network
        T (int): Value of the last simulation time
        contacts (list): List of all the contacts, each given by a list (i, j, t, lambda_ij(t))
        Tensor_to_copy (SparseTensor): An existing SparseTensor to copy and from which to create a new object
        
        Main methods
        ------------
        init_like(Tensor): Initialization of the tensor, given another tensor, putting all values to one
        get_idx_ij(i, j): Returns index corresponding to the (i, j) entrance of the tensor
        get_ij(i, j): Returns the T x T matrix corresponding to the (i, j) entrance of the tensor
        get_neigh_i(i): Returns d_i T x T matrices corresponding to the (*, i) entrances of the tensor
        get_all_indices(i): Returns all the indices corresponding to the incoming and outgoing messages for a given node
```
